        "We would be leveraging the power of LLMs. Google recently launched Gemma and we going to use it. Gemma, a series of lightweight and advanced open models developed by Google, shares the research and technology foundation with the Gemini models. These models, which are decoder-only large language models designed for text-to-text tasks, come in English variants with open weights, pre-trained versions, and instruction-tuned adaptations. Gemma models are adept at various text generation tasks like question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their compact size enables deployment in resource-constrained environments such as laptops, desktops, or personal cloud infrastructure, thus democratizing access to cutting-edge AI models and promoting innovation for all.\n",
