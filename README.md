# Restaurant menu ordering Chatbot using Gemma , Langchain and Chroma DB

Interested in developing a customized chatbot tailored to your business. This article offers a solution to address exactly those challenges! A restaurant chatbot serves various purposes, enhancing customer experience and streamlining operations. Firstly, it facilitates reservations, allowing users to book tables conveniently. Secondly, it provides menu information, catering to dietary preferences and enabling informed ordering. Additionally, it offers assistance with frequently asked questions about operating hours, location, and special offers, reducing the burden on staff. Moreover, it can handle feedback and complaints promptly, improving customer satisfaction and retention. Overall, integrating a restaurant chatbot optimizes service delivery, increases efficiency, and enhances overall customer engagement.


We would be leveraging the power of LLMs. Google recently launched Gemma and we going to use it. Gemma, a series of lightweight and advanced open models developed by Google, shares the research and technology foundation with the Gemini models. These models, which are decoder-only large language models designed for text-to-text tasks, come in English variants with open weights, pre-trained versions, and instruction-tuned adaptations. Gemma models are adept at various text generation tasks like question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their compact size enables deployment in resource-constrained environments such as laptops, desktops, or personal cloud infrastructure, thus democratizing access to cutting-edge AI models and promoting innovation for all.


Achieving the capability for a machine to fully comprehend the various ways humans might inquire about something and respond in natural language akin to a human represents, in my view, a comprehensive goal within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
